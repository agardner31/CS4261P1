1. I had to update my Android Studio to Arctic Fox since I had not used it for a long time. Then, I ran 'flutter doctor' to see if the environment was properly set up to create a Flutter app. It indicated that I needed to update my android licenses, but the root issue was that I needed to update the flutter, dart, and kotlin plugins for android studio and restarted it.
