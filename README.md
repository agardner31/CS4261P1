1. I had to update my Android Studio to Arctic Fox since I had not used it for a long time. Then, I ran 'flutter doctor' to see if the environment was properly set up to create a Flutter app. It indicated that I needed to update my android licenses, but the root issue was that I needed to update the flutter, dart, and kotlin plugins for android studio and restart it as well as update some android sdk tools: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46402772/failed-to-install-android-sdk-java-lang-noclassdeffounderror-javax-xml-bind-a/51644855 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59647791/android-studio-not-installed-when-run-flutter-doctor-while-android-studio-in . Finally the environment was working!
2. I sketched a simple storyboard for my idea, making sure to include the required functionalities. ![alt text](https://github.com/agardner31/CS4261P1/blob/master/storyboard.jpg)
3. Then I set up a simple homepage and lobby for my Virtual Gallery app and pushed this to GitHub :)  
4. The next functionality was a 7-knock requirement to enter the first door of the app and to also add a knock sound to this tap action: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59625936/flutter-detect-triple-tap
